  <p>
    Luxire is an outcome of a happy quest for quality in men's clothing. A world without compromise.
  </p>
  <p>
    In May 2012, Luxire started making Made-to-Measure shirts. With 2 tailors, one master and Ashish, working from a 500 sq feet studio. The first order was from a professor in San Francisco, who is still a dear customer and a loved friend. Thank you Mark.

  <p>
    With undivided attention to quality, we grew slowly and steadily.

    We are driven by our customers. Personal and social Word-of-mouth have been the key to our growth. We do what our customers tell us do, keeping quality as the uncompromising principle. Our team of designers and craftsmen contine working on new designs, products, concepts and our cutomers have always been willing to try them and guide us to make them the best.  We remain well connected with our dear customers. We always refer to our customers by names, even in internal communications, with the order number used to avoid errors.

  <p>
    From what we hear from our customers, once they buy from us and have their fit tuned, they are unable to wear from anywhere else. We work hard to not to let them down.
    Our customer service team works with the customer right from helping them choose fabrics to improving the fit by studying the images they send.

Luxire may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. Once you register with Luxire and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. Luxire automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Luxire cookie information, and the page you request. Luxire uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.</p>

    <p>You can edit your Luxire account information at any time. We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Luxire service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Luxire Newsletter, that are considered part of your Luxire account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them. You can delete your account by contacting Luxire.</p>
    <h3>Confidentiality and Security</h3>

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.</p>
    <h3>Protecting Your Information</h3>
    <p>Luxire does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>
    <p>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Luxire under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Luxire communicate with you about offers from Luxire and our marketing partners.</p>
    <p>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Luxire' terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
    <p>We transfer information about you if Luxire is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Luxire will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
    <h3>Policy Updates</h3>
    <p>Luxire may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Luxire account or by placing a prominent notice on our site</p>

<p>Duties: As shirts are shipped for personal use, many countries do not charge duties on them. In case they are charged, they will be billed to the customer directly by Fedex/DHL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fedex and DHL remain our preferred shipping partners. The packets are sent using 2-Day service and are fully trackable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For areas not serviceable by Fedex/DHL, we will send the packets using the post office.</p>
<p>For items shipped using the post-office, we assume no responsibility for lost packets. We will provide proof of shipping in the form of the receipt from the post office.</p>
<p>DUTIES:</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">

We will refund you 100% of the duty charged, upto 10% of the cost of the garments included in the shipment. We will also reimburse you the duty collection charge the carrier may levy.

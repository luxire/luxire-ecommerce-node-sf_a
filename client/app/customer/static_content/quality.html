      <h2>Quality</h2>
<p>Today, Luxire shirts are probably the best made in the world. Each process followed is the best known, each item and trim are among the best available in the market.</p>
<p>Craftsmanship: Traditional method of shirt making. Each shirt starts with a paper pattern, cut by hand, sewn on single needle machines and hand finished.</p>
<p>Fabric: The very best fabrics, all 100% cotton, primarily from European mills. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Interlining: Wendler of Germany, the best interlinings in the world. We have also developed some custom interlinings that are used on some of our shirts that require the special look or feel</p>
<p>Threads: Guetermann of Germany,&nbsp;among the best in the world</p>
<p>Buttons: Tall mother-of-pearl made of Australian Shell, among the best in the world</p>
<p><b>Shrinkage</b>: We prewash the fabric before making. &nbsp;All fabrics at Luxire are washed and carefully ironed before carving it into your shirt. Some fabrics, like Oxford,&nbsp; shrink more than others. These are washed, dried and ironed 2-3 times before stitching. This reduces the probability of shrinkage. Some fabrics may still rarely shrink upto 1%.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Knitted Fabrics:</strong></p>
<p>Knitted fabrics tend to expand on usage. Thus, the international accepted tolerance level for knits is 5%. Pique fabrics can expand even more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We cut and make the garment exactly as ordered and also try and keep the fabric behavior in mind. Still, a 5-7% difference in size can be expected at&nbsp;different stages of usage during the day.</p>

<p><strong>1. What makes a Luxire garment special?</strong><br>Luxire clothing are in true sense Signature items. The items are made by a single craftsman from start to finish.<br> Each and every input in creating your clothing is among the finest in the world. The fabric is chosen from traditional European mills and tested thoroughly.<br> The interlinings are from Wendler of Germany, the threads are from Gütermann of Germany, buttons are thick mother-of-pearl on shirts and horn on pants, jackets. Copper / brass on jeans.<br> The shirts are made using the single-needle process for a pucker-free, smooth finish using the best machines from Germany and Japan.<br> A Luxire item is crafted to maintain its look, fit and age with perfection.</p>
<p><strong>2. Is a Luxire custom garment really custom made?</strong><br> The Luxire custom garment is made from scratch only for you. After your order is received, the master analyses the size data and cuts out your personal pattern, which is saved with your name on it. &nbsp;Based on the pattern, the fabric is laid out and cut. It is then handed over to the craftsman, who stitches the garment, applies buttons, makes button holes, does the finishing and hands it over for packing.</p>
<p><strong>3. How long does it take to deliver a custom-garment?</strong><br>The custom garment is usually shipped in 2-3 weeks by Fedex Priority and is delivered in 2 business days. Some orders may take longer.</p>

<p><strong>7. Will my garment shrink upon washing?</strong><br> It is natural for all Cotton fabrics to shrink on washing, but that should not worry you. We machine wash and air dry each fabric before making it into your garment. We shrink test our fabrics before stitching them. The percentage of shrinkage is taken into consideration before the pattern is cut for making the garment. Still, there can be minor shrinkage of less than 1% in some fabrics over a few washes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8. What do you mean by "Accurate Size Guaranteed"?</strong></p>
<p>We strive to make the garment true to the size you have ordered. We follow each measurement instruction completely and make sure that the garment is shipped as ordered. If there is a discrepancy, we will alter / remake as per our satisfaction policy. For the garment to qualify for free alteration, the difference in any aspect should be greater than 0.25 inch.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Knitted Fabrics:</strong></p>
<p>Knitted fabrics tend to expand on usage. Thus, the international accepted tolerance level for knits is 5%. Pique fabrics can expand even more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We cut and make the garment exactly as ordered and also try and keep the fabric behavior in mind. Still, a 5-7% difference in size can be expected at&nbsp;different stages of usage during the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9. Are the colors / designs shown on your site accurate?</strong></p>
<p>We make every effort to make sure that the fabric images matches the actual fabric closely. Images can be seen to vary in color based on the monitor settings of your computer.</p>

<p><strong>11. Do you entertain special requests for fabric or style types?</strong><br> Yes, do send us photos of any particular type of shirt you would like to have. Our style experts will work with you to zero down on the fabric, discuss style and deliver the product.</p>
<p><strong>12. How do I order swatches?</strong></p>
